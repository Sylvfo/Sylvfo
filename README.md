I'm Sylvie, a passionnate Project-Based Software Developer living in Switzerland!

Having spent years as an interior designer, I've now transitioned into the thrilling, technical and surprisingly creative world of coding.

Currently studying at 42 Lausanne <img width="96" height="54" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c7ff3a-7adf-43ab-a86b-3d1caf116740" />

I enjoy finding solutions, thinking through algorithms, creating project architecture and building databases.
