### Hi there ðŸ™ƒ

I'm Sylvie, a passionnate Project-Based Software Developer living in Switzerland!

Having spent years as an interior designer, I've now transitioned into the thrilling, technical and surprisingly creative world of coding.

Currently studying at 42 Lausanne <img width="96" height="54" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9c7ff3a-7adf-43ab-a86b-3d1caf116740" />

I enjoy finding solutions, thinking through algorithms, creating project architecture and building databases.

## About me
I enjoy being a human on this planet! 
I love nature, friends, discover new stuff! 
I like to play football, I love to sing! But my first passion is cooking.
Living in a multi culti environment, I can speak fluently 4 languages. French, English, German and Italian. In case, I can also speak some Spanish.
